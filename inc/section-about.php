						<h3>Creative Writer, Researcher, Teacher & Multipotentialite</h3>
						<p>A truly spirited and soulful individual with many different creative pursuits, who channels her creativity and enthusiasm into personal success – that’s Shafrina Khatun for you in a nutshell. She never gets tired of learning, exploring and applying new things. And when it comes to reading and writing something about resourcefulness and self-assertion, she expresses herself with great courage and boldness.</p>
						<p>Having tried many different things in life, she finally found herself unswervingly devoted to Yoga, playing the Cello and writing. She believes that the more we mature and grow, the more complicated the challenges we face. “However, the regular repetition of rumination and self-reflection are the only way to redemption,” she says.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, she admits to the fact that she is profoundly keen to teach everything she learns, and impart the knowledge she has gained from her colorful life experiences, to the learners concerned. In her words, “I’m overwhelmingly blessed to be a teacher as well.”</p>
